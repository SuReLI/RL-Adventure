ISAE-Supaero 2d year PIR Research Project by Paul Carfantan

- Implementation of Rainbow in PyTorch

- Missing Distributional DQN (C51) 

- Experiments performed and validated on LunarLander, AcroBot & CartPole

- Missing experiments to validate the implementation on longer & harder benchmarks (ATARI)

- 2 arguments to launch the program :
python rainbowPIR.py CUDA render -> to use CUDA if available and render the training
(any other string instead of CUDA or render to discard those)
